# Gremlin Game
What I want: remember this idea
Why: I think it's fun and cool and could be a rewarding hobby project and get attention

In short: Fantasy ecology iteration of Games for AI. Make a bunch of different interesting fantasy creatures (defined by abilities and objective fn) and then co-train all of them.
